# Data_Science
A collection of data science examples

1.) Data Science Example Rental cars - Trying to discover what makes people want to rent a car. Uses two CSV files, uploaded as databases, which relate car ID number to various parameters. Involves merging, analysis, visualization, feature engineering, feature selection.

2.) Lya_Emitters - Basic DNN implementation with Random Forest Comparison to classify and predict whether a galaxy with given photometric properties will be spectroscopically confirmed as a Lyman-alpha emitter. 

3.) cluster_classification.R - A program written in R to classify different types of astronomical objects based upon SDSS imaging properties (colors in different filters). Goes through multiple unsupervised clustering algorithms, a simple neural network example, and a few machine learning routines to derive the answers. Useful for identifying unknows in imaging, where data is sparse.
